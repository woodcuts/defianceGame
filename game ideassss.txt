PUZZLE GAME
grid
you start with 4 green blocks and other blocks light up as you shift, the furthest opposite
direction block of where you move, the block will no longer be green, because you are "moving".

there are walls that you cannot traverse or blocks that cause penalties

then you need to either solve a puzzle to get that block back or find another green
"controllable" block in order to complete the level
